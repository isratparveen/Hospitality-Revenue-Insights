# Problem Statement:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Domain:
Hospitality

# Steps Involved:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Transformation using Power Query and Data Modeling 
3. Building Metrics using DAX
4. Building Dashboard
5. Retrieving Insights

# Insights:
1. The Average Daily Rate(ADR) shows that this hotel has the Fixed Pricing strategy 
2. The line chart shows that the Revenue Per Available Room(RevPAR) changes because occupancy is changing
3. The occupancy and average rating goes hand in hand, when the rating is low, the occupancy is also low. So we see that the rating affects the occupancy.
4. The offline channel of this hotel has got the highest rates, and the online channel has got the lowest rates. 
5. The revenue generated from luxury caegory is more compared to business category.
6. The highest revenue generated is from Mumbai which is 0.66 bn.
7. The business class rooms have more occupancy that luxury class.

# Conclusion:
By looking at the insights, we see that the main issue with this hotel is Pricing. The whole order can be changed by having a proper Pricing Strategy.
